# Land-Registration-Using-Blockchain
This project provides the security of property or land  
document generation. It is used to identify and prevent fraud  
and document forgery of a large magnitude, that demands a  
fitting defense. It is required to manage the records and  
tracking the records as they move forward from person to  
person. This approach renders all classes of crimes involving  
fake representation of documents impossible by providing a  
    web interface powered by blockchain technology.
